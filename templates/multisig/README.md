# Aragon 0.8 Fundraising Multisig Template

## Description
Aragon Fundraising Multisig Template differenciate two set actors: the **board** and the **shareholders**.

### Board

The board are the ones being funded by the fundraising campaign. They are represented through a custom `BOARD` token and a dedicated voting app set to be used as a multisig. Their privileges are intentionnaly limited to protect shareholders. Thus, they only have the following rights.

#### Handling board members

The board decides on who is to be included / excluded from the board [through its `TokenManager`].

#### Opening presale

The board decides on when the presale [and thus the fundraising campaign] is to be open.

#### Handling fundraising proceeds

The board decides on what use is to be made of the fundraising proceeds which are periodically transferred to their discretionnary `Vault` / `Finance` app.

#### Opening votes

The board decides on when new votes should be open for shareholders to enforce decisions over the organization.


### Shareholders

The shareholders are the one contributing to the fundraising campaign. They are represented through a `SHARE` bonded-token [they can buy and redeem through the Aragon Fundraising interface] and a voting app. They hold most of the rights over the organization.

#### Handling system

Shareholders decide on which apps are to be installed, which apps are to to upgraded and how permissions are to be set.

#### Handling fundraising parameters

Shareholders decide on whether / how beneficiary, fees, collateralization settings and collaterals taps should be updated.

### Rationale

This architecture grants [most of] the governance rights to shareholders [to protect their investment]. There is thus a need to mitigate situations where a shareholder owning more than 50% of the shares would own the whole organization. This is why `SHARE` based votes [_i.e._ most of the organization decisions] can only be open and initiated by the board.

- **maximumTapRateIncreasePct** The maximum percentage tap rates can be increased at once
- **maximumTapFloorDecreasePct** The maximum percentage tap floors can be decreased at once

### Finalize instance
> Set collateralization settings

template.finalizeInstance(virtualSupplies, virtualBalances, slippages, daiRate, daiFloor)
```

- **virtualSupplies** Array of [daiVirtualSupply, antVirtualSupply] to set up the market maker
