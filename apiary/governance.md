# Governance

Due to the flexibility of aragonOS, projects created on the Apiary platform can have a wide variety of governance structures from a personal DAO where an individual manages a project but is funded and supported by patrons \(similar to patreon\), to community projects where token holders are expected to actively participate in key governance decisions.

To ensure users have a good understanding of what participation in a project entails it is important for Apiary to have a standard that is common among all projects on the platform.

## Project Tokens

Projects listed on the Apiary platform will have a project token which is minted by the projects Bonding Curve \(Section 2\). These tokens can be used by the project to grant additional project specific perks, utilities, and/or discounts to patrons, but said perks are not guaranteed or endorsed by the Apiary platform. Users of the platform understand and agree that the only guaranteed utility of the project tokens are to support the creators of a project.

## Groups and Privileges

Within an organization holders of the project token form a group within the organization called patrons. The organization can use the Access Control List \(ACL\) provided by aragonOS to grant patrons specific privileges. The set of privileges granted to patrons can be read from the organizations ACL and displayed on the Apiary project page. By providing more attractive privileges to patrons, project organizers can attract more patronage to their project.

Privileges can include voting on how funds in the projects discretionary pool are allocated, signalling for various directions the project organizers could take, or used directly to interact with key pieces of the project such as making challenges on a token curated registry \(TCR\).

As the ecosystem of aragonOS compatible applications grows the number of privileges organizations can grant and list on the Apiary platform is infinite.
