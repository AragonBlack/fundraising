# Introduction

## Background

The ability to collaborate with one another has enabled humanity to rise above the limits of our individual capacity. However, our ability to collaborate is currently limited by our existing systems and institutions. The emergence of smart-contract enabled blockchain platforms like Ethereum can help strip away many of those limitations, reduce information asymmetry and improve trust between individuals without relying on centralized intermediaries.

## Curation Markets

Curation markets can be thought of as markets for voice and attention within communities. At a high level the ICO trend on the Ethereum platform is itself a curation market where individuals become active stakeholders within communities by purchasing project specific tokens. Unfortunately, Ethereum ICOs burden participants with excessive risk due to a lack of accountability and poor liquidity.

## Accountability

Tokens are not equities so they do not grant the same privileges and protections of centralized regulatory authorities. One approach to solving this is to only issue securitized-tokens that fit into existing frameworks, but this approach restricts participation to a small-subset of individuals and offers little improvement on our collective ability to collaborate globally. A better approach is to provide mechanisms that improve accountability and transparency so that heavy-handed regulation becomes unnecessary.

## Long-tail Liquidity

Market liquidity is an important factor in assessing the risk for an individual participating in a market. However, small markets are typically very illiquid due to a relatively small number of buyers and sellers. In an extreme case all participants may want to buy at the same time or sell at the same time causing extreme volatility. Since organizations may be very small it is important to supplement market liquidity in order to smooth out market volatility and reduce risk to participants.
