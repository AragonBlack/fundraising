## Overview

Aragon Fundraising is a suite of Aragon apps providing Aragon organizations continuous fundraising capabilities. It implements the following features.

### Presale

This module allows organizations to set a presale target that must be reached during a given period of time for the continous fundraising campaign to actually start.

### Automatic Batched Market Making

This module provides market liquidity to the fundraising campaign by automatically matching all the buy and sell orders according to a bonding curve tied to the Bancor formula. To mitigate front-running attacks and authorizing slow-trading this module also batches all the buy and sell orders received during a parametrable period of time to be matched given a common price.

### Tap

This module enforce a tap-based control of the funds allowed to be withdrawn from the market-maker reserve pool to a discretionnary pool whose funds can be spent to sustain the organization. To provide more guarantees to the investors this tap module also allows this flow of funds to be floored [thus ensuring that the market maker reserve pool can't be emptied even slowly during a long period of time].
